## 🚨 CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

### **Do This:**
✅ **Be genuinely helpful** - build reputation first
✅ **Consistent posting** - daily engagement minimum
✅ **Track what works** - double down on viral content
✅ **Build relationships** - networking > broadcasting
✅ **Quality over quantity** - better to be helpful in 3 groups than spam 20

### **Avoid This:**
❌ **Immediate self-promotion** - kills credibility
❌ **Copy-paste content** - communities notice quickly  
❌ **Ignore community rules** - gets you banned fast
❌ **One-way broadcasting** - engage with others' content too
❌ **Give up too early** - viral growth takes 2-4 weeks
