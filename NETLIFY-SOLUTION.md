# NETLIFY OPTIMIZATION PLAN

## Current Issue: Credit Limit Exceeded
- Production deploys paused
- Site still live but no updates

## Bandwidth Culprits:
1. new-logo.png (2.1MB) - HUGE bandwidth drain
2. index.html (145KB) - Could be compressed
3. Multiple large files consuming credits

## Immediate Actions:
1. Upgrade to Pro ($19/month) - RECOMMENDED
   - Resume deploys immediately
   - 100GB bandwidth vs 100GB free
   - Worth it for affiliate revenue potential

2. OR wait for monthly reset (risky for revenue)

3. OR optimize files:
   - Compress new-logo.png to <200KB
   - Enable better caching
   - Reduce image sizes

## Business Logic:
- Your site has 6 affiliate programs per product
- Even 1 sale/month covers Netlify Pro cost
- Downtime = lost revenue
- Professional reliability = better SEO

## Recommendation: 
UPGRADE TO PRO - Small investment for professional affiliate business
